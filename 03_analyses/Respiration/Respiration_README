The files in the respiration analysis folder are to be replaced by the ones provided by Mark Urban and/or Linda Deegan after they have finished working with them.

These current files, including "CommonGarden_RespirationAnalysis_HG20220721.Rmd" and "YOY_Data_RSGdata_HG_2022.R", are just temporary placeholders and should be considered as BACKUP FILES.
