The CG_AbioticConditions folder contains the following files:

1. CG_TankTempsChemistry_UNFINISHED.xlsx
NOTE: THIS SPREADSHEET NEEDS TO HAVE THE DATA VERIFIED AND REPEATED DATA ROWS REMOVED.

Columns include: 
HG.checked: checked if the data has been varified by cross-checking the original data entry sheets (three ring binder)

TreatmentTemp.C: 8 Degrees C (T1), 12 degrees C (T2), 16 degrees C (T3)

TreatmentTank: T1 (8 Degrees C), T2 (12 degrees C), T3 (16 degrees C)

Aquarium: Either A1, A2, A3, A4 within each of the Treatment tanks

Chamber.num: NEEDS TO BE REMOVED SO DATA IS NOT REPEATED IN THIS FILE

Location: NEEDS TO BE REMOVED SO DATA IS NOT REPEATED IN THIS FILE

Date: Date the data was collected

days.post.fert: number of days post fertilization - REMOVE - NOT NECESSARY FOR THIS DATA FILE

Aquarium.Temp.C: Aquarium tank temperatures using hand-held thermometer (not very accurate compared to iButton temperature logger data)

Nitrate.ppm: Aquarium tank NITRATE using aquarium test strips

nitrite.ppm: Aquarium tank NITRITE using aquarium test strips

hardness.ppm: Aquarium tank HARDNESS using aquarium test strips

chlorine.ppm: Aquarium tank CHLORINE using aquarium test strips

alkalinity.ppm: Aquarium tank ALKALINITY using aquarium test strips

pH: Aquarium tank pH using aquarium test strips

2. TankAquarium_TemperatureReadings.csv:
Columns include: Date, tank,aquarium, tank_aq, Aquarium.Temp.C

This file contains hand-held temperature readings from the CG_TankTempsAndChemistry_UNFINISHED.xlsx spreadsheet for the common garden experimental tanks and aquariums within each tank. 

NOTE: These temperature readings are not as accurate as the iButton temperature logger data deployed within each tank and should not be used for manuscript analyses.
